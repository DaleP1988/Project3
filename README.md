# **Save My Asana (prototype)**

Save My Asana is a matching app for the wellness industry. The app provides yoga students the best possible instructor for their practice, by pairing them with specialized instructors and wellness professionals. Clients can search for instructors whom have either created a profile in the app, or whom use the wellness service booking application called Mind Body Online (MBO). The application uses the MBO API to access instructor data. Once the client has created a profile he or she can take a quick survey to provide the app with an understanding of his or her yoga style, level and needs. With this information, the app finds the best instructor match. Clients are then provided with instructor information for scheduling or booking. Clients can also message their instructors directly through the app.

Save My Asana is a prototype written in JavaScript/JQuery and React.js. Surveys for the application were generated in Survey.js. The UI was styled with React - Materialize and Google Fonts. It is designed and configured as a fullstack application, utilizing MySQL, Express.js. Node.js. Currently, the front end UI is mostly functional. The sorting and back end data storage processes are under construction.
